# Interactive Visualization of Interaction in Regression

The demonstration script `interaction.R` will run an interactive visualization of how an interaction term affects a regression surface.

## Installation

This demonstration requires the use of the RStudio application, which contains the required "manipulate" package.

You may install the files for this demonstration in one of three different ways:
1. Clone the repo using git
2. Download a ZIP of this entire folder
3. Download the following files individually:
  - `demo_moderation_viz.Rproj`
  - `depression_intxn.txt`
  - `interaction.R`

You must then install package "lattice" in RStudio:
```R
install.packages("lattice")
```

## Execute

Use RStudio to run the entire script in file `interaction.R`.
